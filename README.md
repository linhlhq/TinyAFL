# TinyAFL

Release Version: 1.2

TinyAFL is built on top of AFL and [TinyInst](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/TinyInst).

It can be fuzz on windows user-mode application without source (supports both x32 and x64) but it is not so reliable and dirty. It still has some instrument bugs, I will fix it when I fully understand TinyInst :P

## Features of TinyAFL
TinyAFL works similarly to WinAFL. However I use TinyInst (commit [cfb9b15a53e5e6489f2f72c77e804fb0a7af94b5](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/TinyInst/tree/cfb9b15a53e5e6489f2f72c77e804fb0a7af94b5)) for coverage. More about TinyInst can be found [here](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/TinyInst/tree/cfb9b15a53e5e6489f2f72c77e804fb0a7af94b5/README.md).

TinyAFL supports [AFLfast](https://github.com/mboehme/aflfastTinyAFL)'s power schedules by Marcel BÃ¶hme and MOpt mutator of [MOpt-AFL](https://github.com/puppet-meteor/MOpt-AFL). I add these features based on [afl++](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus)

## Building TinyAFL
Although TinyAFL x64 can run both for 32bit and 64bit targets, I still recommend TinyAFL 32bit for 32bit targets and TinyAFL 64bit for 64bit targets.

1. Open a terminal and set up your build environment (e.g. On Windows, run vcvars64.bat / vcvars32.bat)
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source
3. Run the following commands (change the generator according to the version of IDE and platform you want to build for):
#### For a 64-bit Build
```
mkdir build64
cd build64
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```
## How to fuzz with TinyAFL
The command line for TinyAFL:
```
AFL.exe [ afl options ] -- target_cmd_line
```
The following TinyAFL options are supported:
```
Required parameters:

  -i dir        - input directory with test cases
  -o dir        - output directory for fuzzer findings

Execution control settings:

  -p schedule   - power schedules recompute a seed's performance score.
                  <explore(default), fast, coe, lin, quad, exploit, mmopt, rare>
  -f file       - location read by the fuzzed program (stdin)
  -s            - use share memory
  -t msec       - timeout for each run
  -Q            - use binary-only instrumentation (QEMU mode)

Mutator settings:

  -L minutes    - use MOpt(imize) mode and set the time limit for entering the
                  pacemaker mode (minutes of no new paths). 0 = immediately,
                  -1 = immediately and together with normal mutation).

Fuzzing behavior settings:

  -x dir        - optional fuzzer dictionary (see README)

Other stuff:

  -M / -S id    - distributed mode (see parallel_fuzzing.txt)
  -C            - crash exploration mode (the peruvian rabbit thing)
  -e ext        - file extension for the fuzz test input file (if needed)
  -header_only  - mutate only header of testcase (if needed)
  -size_of_header  - size of header will mutate when use option -header_only (default: 0x200)

tiny-afl settings:

  -instrument_module path       - path to instrumented PE
```
I add the feature to only mutate the test case header when fuzz (depending on the file format). I believe that some file format exceptions only happen when fields in the header change. To see the supported instrument flags, please refer to the mode-specific documentation at TinyInst.

## Shared memory mode

WinAFL supports shared memory mode. This can be enabled by giving -s option to AFL.exe.
If you are using shared memory mode then you need to make sure that in your harness you specifically read data from shared memory/stream instead of file. check a simple harness here:  

https://github.com/googleprojectzero/Jackalope/blob/6d92931b2cf614699e2a023254d5ee7e20f6e34b/test.cpp#L111  
https://github.com/googleprojectzero/Jackalope/blob/6d92931b2cf614699e2a023254d5ee7e20f6e34b/test.cpp#L41  

#### Example command TinyAFL 
```
AFL.exe -i in -o out -p fast -t 10000 -callconv fastcall -target_offset 0x1260 -nargs 2 -loop -persist -iterations 10000 -instrument_module demo.dll -target_module test.exe -- test.exe -f @@
```
#### Corpus minimization
```
python winafl-cmin.py -h
[...]
Examples of use:
 * Typical use
  afl-cmin.py -t 5000 -i in -o min -p demo.dll -- test.exe
 * Dry-run, keep crashes only with 4 workers with a working directory:
  afl-cmin.py -C --dry-run -w 4 --working-dir D:\dir -i in -i C:\fuzz\in -o min -p demo.dll -- test.exe -f @@
 * Read specific file on specific location
  afl-cmin.py -t 5000 -i in -o min -f foo.ext -p m.dll -- test.exe -f @@
 * Read from specific file with pattern
  afl-cmin.py -t 5000 -i in -o min -f prefix-@@-foo.ext -p demo.dll -- test.exe -f @@
```
#### Minimize testcase
```
afl-tmin.exe -h
[...]
afl-tmin.exe [ options ] -- /path/to/target_app [ ... ]

Required parameters:

  -i file       - input test case to be shrunk by the tool
  -o file       - final output location for the minimized data
  -instrument_module module     - target module to test

Execution control settings:

  -t msec       - timeout for each run (10000 ms)
```
