# visibilities are one of [EXPLICIT|IMPLICIT|SUPPRESSED]

# Major properties of the fields are determined by the columns with
#  the content {EI,EO} or {DI,DO,DS}. EI is encoder inputs and EO is
#  for encoder outputs.  DI is decoder inputs, DO is decoder
#  outputs. And DS means "decoder skip" and is used for fields that
#  show up in instruction pattern constraints but should be completely
#  ignored by the decoder.


# INTERNAL means that the field is excluded from the instructions'
#  operands array template.
